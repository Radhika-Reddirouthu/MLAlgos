This is a Machine Learning related code where I have checked the accuracy by trainig a data set with different algorithms
I have used a income prediction dataset where by giving few details like age, education, occupation..etc the model should be able to predict if the income is above 50K or below 50K

If any other data set is used then data cleaning, data splitting parts of the code need to be changed

The algorithms used in this are:
Decision Tree (entropy)along with GridSearchCV
Decision Tree with gini index
Linear Regression
SVM
SVM along with GridSearchCV

For the dataset I have choosen I got the best accuracy for Decision Tree with Gini Index (Approximately around 85%)
